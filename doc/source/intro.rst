PRIMME: PReconditioned Iterative MultiMethod Eigensolver
--------------------------------------------------------

PRIMME, pronounced as *prime*, finds a number of eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors of a 
real symmetric, or Hermitian matrix. Also singular values and vectors can be computed. Largest, smallest and interior 
eigenvalues and singular values are supported. Preconditioning can be used to accelerate 
convergence. 
PRIMME is written in C99, but complete interfaces are provided for Fortran 77, MATLAB and Python.
  
Incompatibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From PRIMME 1.x to 2.0:

* Prototype of callbacks has changed: |matrixMatvec|, |applyPreconditioner|, |massMatrixMatvec| and |globalSumReal|.

* The next parameters are :c:type:`PRIMME_INT`: |n|, |nLocal|, |maxMatvecs|, |iseed|, |numOuterIterations|, |numRestarts|, |numMatvecs| and |numMatvecs|; use the macro ``PRIMME_INT_P`` to print the values.

* Rename the values of the enum :c:type:`primme_preset_method`.

* Rename ``primme_Free`` to :c:func:`primme_free`.

* Integer parameters in Fortran functions are of the same size as :c:type:`PRIMME_INT`, which is ``integer*8`` by default.

* Extra parameter in many Fortran functions to return the error code.

* Removed ``primme_display_stats_f77``.

Changelog
^^^^^^^^^
Changes in PRIMME 2.1 (released on XXX):

* Support Octave.

Changes in PRIMME 2.0 (released on September 19, 2016):

* Changed license to BSD 3-clause.

* New support for singular value problems; see :c:func:`dprimme_svds`.

* New support for ``float`` and ``complex float`` arithmetic.

* Support for problem dimensions larger than 2^31, without requiring
  BLAS_ and LAPACK_ compiled with 64-bits integers.

* Improve robustness and performance for interior problems; implemented advanced refined
  and harmonic-Ritz extractions.

* Python interface compatible with NumPy_ and `SciPy Library`_.

* Added parameter to indicate the leading dimension of the input/output matrices and to
  return an error code in callbacks |matrixMatvec|, |applyPreconditioner|,
  |massMatrixMatvec| and |globalSumReal|.

* Changed to type :c:type:`PRIMME_INT` the options |n|, |nLocal|, |maxMatvecs|
  and |iseed|, and the stats counters |numOuterIterations|, |numRestarts|, |numMatvecs|,
  |numPreconds|. Also changed |realWorkSize| to ``size_t``. Fortran interface functions
  will expect an ``interger`` of size compatible with :c:type:`PRIMME_INT` for
  all parameters with integer type: ``int``, :c:type:`PRIMME_INT` and ``size_t``;
  see also parameter ``value`` in functions
  :c:func:`primmetop_set_member_f77`,
  :c:func:`primmetop_get_member_f77`,
  :c:func:`primme_set_member_f77` and
  :c:func:`primme_get_member_f77`.

* Added parameter to return an error code in Fortran interface functions:
  :c:func:`primmetop_set_member_f77`,
  :c:func:`primmetop_get_member_f77`,
  :c:func:`primme_set_member_f77` and
  :c:func:`primme_get_member_f77`.

* Added leading dimension for ``evecs`` |ldevecs| and preferred leading dimension
  for the operators |ldOPs|, such as |matrixMatvec|.

* Optional user-defined convergence function, |convTestFun|.

* Prefixed methods with ``PRIMME_``. Rename Fortran constants from ``PRIMMEF77_``
  to ``PRIMME_``.

* Removed ``primme_display_stats_f77``.

Changes in PRIMME 1.2.2 (released on October 13, 2015):

* Fixed wrong symbols in :file:`libdprimme.a` and :file:`libzprimme.a`.

* :c:func:`primme_set_method` sets |JDQMR| instead of |JDQMR_ETol| for preset methods
  |DEFAULT_MIN_TIME| and |DYNAMIC| when seeking interior values.

* Fixed compilation of driver with a PETSc_ installation without HYPRE.

* Included the content of the environment variable ``INCLUDE`` for compiling the driver.


Changes in PRIMME 1.2.1 (released on September 7, 2015):

* Added MATLAB interface to full PRIMME functionality.

* Support for BLAS_/LAPACK_ with 64bits integers (``-DPRIMME_BLASINT_SIZE=64``).

* Simplified configuration of Make_flags and Make_links (removed ``TOP`` variable 
  and replaced defines ``NUM_SUM`` and ``NUM_IBM`` by ``F77UNDERSCORE``).

* Replaced directories :file:`DTEST` and :file:`ZTEST` by :file:`TEST`, that has:

  * :file:`driver.c`: read matrices in MatrixMarket format and PETSc_ binary and
    call PRIMME with the parameters specified in a file; support
    complex arithmetic and MPI and can use PETSc_ preconditioners.
  * :file:`ex*.c` and :file:`ex*.f`: small, didactic examples of usage in C and Fortran
    and in parallel (with PETSc_).

* Fixed a few minor bugs and improved documentation (especially the F77 interface).

* Using Sphinx_ to manage documentation.

Changes in PRIMME 1.2 (released on December 21, 2014):

* A Fortran compiler is no longer required for building the PRIMME library.
  Fortran programs can still be linked to PRIMME's F77 interface.

* Fixed some uncommon issues with the F77 interface.

* PRIMME can be called now multiple times from the same program.

* Performance improvements in the QMR inner solver, especially for 
  complex arithmetic.

* Fixed a couple of bugs with the locking functionality. 

  * In certain extreme cases where all eigenvalues of a matrix were needed.
  * The order of selecting interior eigenvalues.

  The above fixes have improved robustness and performance. 

* PRIMME now assigns unique random seeds per parallel process 
  for up to 4096^3  (140 trillion) processes.

* For the |DYNAMIC| method, fixed issues with initialization and 
  synchronization decisions across multiple processes.

* Fixed uncommon library interface bugs, coordinated better
  setting the method and the user setting of parameters, and improved 
  the interface in the sample programs and makefiles.

* Other performance and documentation improvements.

.. _making :

Making and Linking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:file:`Make_flags` has the flags and compilers used to make :file:`libprimme.a`:

* `CC`, compiler program such as ``gcc``, ``clang`` or ``icc``.
* `CFLAGS`, compiler options such as ``-g`` or ``-O3`` and macro definitions
   like the ones described next.

Compiler flags for the BLAS_ and LAPACK_ libraries:

* ``-DF77UNDERSCORE``, if Fortran appends an underscore to function names
  (usually it does).
* ``-DPRIMME_BLASINT_SIZE=64``, if the library integers are 64-bit integer (``kind=8``) type,
  aka ILP64 interface; usually integers are 32-bits even in 64-bit architectures (aka LP64 interface).

By default PRIMME sets the integer type for matrix dimensions and counters (:c:type:`PRIMME_INT`)
to 64 bits integer ``int64_t``. This can be changed by setting the macro ``PRIMME_INT_SIZE``
to one of the following values:

- ``0``: use the regular ``int`` of your compiler.
- ``32``: use C99 ``int32_t``. 
- ``64``: use C99 ``int64_t``. 

.. note::

   When ``-DPRIMME_BLASINT_SIZE=64`` is set the code uses the type ``int64_t``
   supported by the C99 standard. In case the compiler doesn't honor the
   standard, you can set the corresponding type name supported, for instance
   ``-DPRIMME_BLASINT_SIZE=__int64``.

After customizing :file:`Make_flags`, type this to generate :file:`libprimme.a`::

    make lib

Making can be also done at the command line::

    make lib CC=clang CFLAGS='-O3'

:file:`Link_flags` has the flags for linking with external libraries and making the executables
located in :file:`examples` and :file:`tests`:

* `LDFLAGS`, linker flags such as ``-framework Accelerate``.
* `LIBS`, flags to link with libraries (BLAS_ and LAPACK_ are required), such as ``-lprimme -llapack -lblas -lgfortran -lm``.

After that, type this to compile and execute a simple test::

    $ make test
    ...
    Test passed!
    ...
    Test passed! 

In case of linking problems check flags in `LDFLAGS` and `LIBS` and consider
to add/remove ``-DF77UNDERSCORE`` from `CFLAGS`. If the execution fails consider
to add/remove ``-DPRIMME_BLASINT_SIZE=64`` from `CFLAGS`.

Full description of actions that `make` can take:

* `make lib`, builds the static library :file:`libprimme.a`.
* `make solib`, builds the shared library :file:`libprimme.so`.
* `make test`, build and execute simple examples.
* `make clean`, removes all :file:`*.o`, :file:`a.out`, and core files from :file:`src`.

Considerations using an IDE
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

PRIMME can be built in other environments such as Anjuta, Eclipse, KDevelop, Qt Creator,
Visual Studio and XCode. To build the PRIMME library do the following:

#. Create a new project and include the source files under the directory :file:`src`.
#. Add the directories :file:`include` and :file:`src/include` as include directories.

To build an example code using PRIMME make sure:

- to add a reference for PRIMME, BLAS_ and LAPACK_ libraries;
- to add the directory :file:`include` as an include directory.
